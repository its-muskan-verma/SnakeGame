# SnakeGame
It is a web application-based game made using jQuery and JavaScript that
depicts the usage of Event Listeners and Animation Frames.
In this a snake moves around a box trying to eat the food. 
Once it successfully eats it, the length of the snake increases. 
The game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of 
the four walls of the box or any wooden block that are placed inside the board.
I have also used various sound effects in this game.

I have used an array for the snake and a division or block for the food.
Whenever the snake eats the food, there's an increment in the snake's length
