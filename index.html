
//Game Intro - SnakeMania
// It is a web application-based game made using jQuery and JavaScript that
// depicts the usage of Event Listeners and Animation Frames.
//In this a snake moves around a box trying to eat the food. 
//Once it successfully eats it, the length of the snake increases. 
//The game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of 
//the four walls of the box or any wooden block that are placed inside the board.
//I have also used various sound effects in this game.

// I have used an array for the snake and a division or block for the food.
//Whenever the snake eats the food, there's an increment in the snake's length
